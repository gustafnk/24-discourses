<div>In the <a href="s-s1-s2-a.html">Universe of the Master</a>, the Discourse of the Analysand can be seen as the subversive discourse, since it directly opposite of the Discourse of the Master. However, in the post-modern universe, this is not the case. Instead, here the analysand is addressing S<sub>1</sub> and subject is produced. This seems to be very far from the traditional role of the analysand. Who is the analysand?</div>
<div>The analysand acts more like an hysteric, who in the Universe of the Master, addresses S<sub>1</sub>, questioning truth/ideology. But why does this produce subject?</div>
<div>"<em>a</em> represents S<sub>2</sub>" could be interpreted as "jouissance is really like language", i.e. unless there exists a fix-point of meaning (S<sub>1</sub>), the signifiers are just "floating around" – and unless jouissance gets a meaning, it's just "enjoyment-pain without meaning/cause".</div>
<div>This "meaningless pair of jouissance" is addressing S<sub>1</sub> and produce subject. But since we're already in the ideology of jouissance, we reach a deadlock, an infinite loop. Which in turn creates the post-modern subject, always in search for meaning in meaningless jouissance (but it is never found).</div>
<div>Could this also explain the rise of "brand/product storytelling" – we have a desire for "why", but the storytellings of products ("the coffee farmer's story", "locally cultivated", etc) never function as "creational myths" or fables.</div>
