<div>This is the subversive discourse in the post-modern universe.</div>
<div>In this discourse, Lacan's original reversal of the subject ($) and the master (S<sub>1</sub>) results in a form of "revolutionary university", compared to the Discourse of the University in the master's universe: instead of S<sub>1</sub> setting the agenda for the search of new knowledge (addressing <em>a</em> – here the unsymbolised/Real), the agenda is set by the subject itself. The result is a new master.</div>
<div>If the master in the post-modern universe is jouissance, this discourse is questioning not only jouissance as meaning, but this level of meaning itself – "we must strive for higher goals" – reviving ideology, grand narratives, etc.</div>
