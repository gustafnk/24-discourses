<div>Compared to the Discourse of the Master in the master's universe, this discourse reverses the product and thruth of that discourse.</div>
<div>One interpretation is that S<sub>1</sub> questions <em>a</em> - "it's not good to base existence on jouissance" – and this questioning produce knowledge</div>
<div>Or, maybe S<sub>1</sub> realizes that <em>a</em> is a force of control (that should be persisted) and the produced knowledge is knowledge of jouissance itself (the human body's chemical systems, virtual reality, drugs, etc): "how can jouissance be used to maintain power?".</div>
<div>But if one instead thinks of <em>a</em> as the "MacGuffin of the world" [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_petit_a">1</a>], which could render the S<sub>1</sub> a "searcher for something that will never exist", a conspiracist, or paranoid. Still, this process produces knowledge.</div>
<div>In the master's universe, we find that it's the Discourse of the University that addresses the <em>a</em>. What interpretation could be drawn from this? Maybe, it's an impatient master that – instead of using the university to address the unknown – addresses the unknown directly itself and uses it to rule. The scientist is also the ruler. But what should then this scientific ruler value, without an S<sub>1</sub> that dictates an aesthetic function?</div>
