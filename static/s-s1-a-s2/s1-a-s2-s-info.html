<div>This version of The Discourse of the Analysand is quite similar to the version in the post-modern universe, except that S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> are reversed.</div>
<div>Why would S<sub>1</sub> – represented by <em>a</em>, addressing S<sub>1</sub> – produce subject?</div>
<div>One interprentation, maybe naive, is that jouissance is "barred" by S<sub>1</sub>, and knowledge about different practices of getting jouissance is either elevated or repressed. An attempt to objectify jouissance. However, this attempt fail and gives rise to subject.</div>
