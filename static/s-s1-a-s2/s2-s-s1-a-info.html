<div>The Discourse of the Hysteric is similar to the one in the master's universe: the subject is questioning the S<sub>1</sub>. But here the subject is not representing <em>a</em>, but instead representing S<sub>2</sub> (knowledge). And instead of producing knowledge, this discourse is producing <em>a</em>.</div>
<div>Could "$ over S<sub>2</sub>" be read as a kind of "knowledgeable subject" that questions S<sub>1</sub>? Some form of intellectual with no goal other than critique existing power or ideology?</div>
<div>Then, why is <em>a</em> produced? Because S<sub>1</sub> is questioned (and maybe intellectually defeated), it is leaving behind a remainder, which in turn would produce another S<sub>1</sub>, maintaining the loop.</div>
