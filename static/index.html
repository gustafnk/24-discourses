    <h1>The 24 Discourses</h1>
    <p><em>Based on Lacan's four (or five) discourses.</em></p>

    <a href="images/cube.svg"><img src="images/cube.svg" width="50%" /></a>

    <p>Quite a lot has been written about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_discourses">Lacan's four discourses</a>. If you have never heard about them, you might want to read up on them first.</p>

    <p>But Lacan apparently came up with the idea of a <a href="./a-s1-s-s2.html">fifth discourse</a> [<a href="https://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/the-discourse-of-the-capitalist-and-the-new-symptom/">1</a>, <a href="https://seansturm.wordpress.com/2010/09/11/lacans-four-or-five-discourses-beware-all-ye-who-enter-here/">2</a>] in his <em>Seminar XVII, The Other Side of Psychoanalysis</em>. This opens up the idea of other (Lacanian) universes, other than the original Universe of the Master.</p>

    <p>All in all, there are six different universes with four discourses in each, so a total of 24 discourses. This website enumerates all the universes and discourses. Also, we give some possible interpretations (sometimes multiple ones), but the reader is encouraged to make their own interpretation as they get familiar with the different universes and recurring combinations of terms.</p>

    <p>The six universes can form a cube, so that they become a bit easier to grasp. A universe page will start with a "map" of a folded-out cube and where you currently are, like this:</p>
